The enormous usage of electronic devices and wireless appliances, which are
mainly used for sharing interactive content like audio, video, etc., has resulted
in excessive spectral usage. But, the spectrum hasn't been utilized efficiently
and most of the frequency bands are only used for a short time and left unused
for the rest of the time. This kind of spectral usage is prevalent in cellular
connections. The frequencies that are allotted for cellular connections have
been left unused for a long time from late night to early morning and are being
extensively used during peak hours mainly the daytime. Generally, the spectrum
of radio frequency is distributed in such a way that it is fixed to certain users
called licensed users and it cannot be used by unlicensed users even though the
spectrum is not in use. This type of spectrum allocation doesn't let unlicensed
users access the spectrum even if it is free. This inefficient use of spectrum leads
to spectral holes. To overcome the problem of spectral holes and increase the
efficiency of the spectrum, the Cognitive Radio (CR) concept is introduced.
